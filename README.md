# Advent of Code 2018

![Rust workflow](https://github.com/tacgomes/advent-of-code-2018/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

My solutions in Rust to the [Advent of Code], 2018 edition.

## Building and Running

All the programs are organised in a Cargo workspace. Running the following
instructions will build all the programs and, as an example, run the program to
solve the _Part 1_ of the _Puzzle 01_:

```sh
cargo build
cargo run --bin 01-part1 01/input.txt
```
